Final Presentation Deck

Conducted data science research at the U.S. Air Force Operational Energy to optimize fuel logistics networks and build operational plans that address risk; For every flow object, the flow along each edge is an input variable and the score for the entire flow plan is the output variable; Used a regression model because it works best with the data points (various numerical features that correspond to a numerical output).
